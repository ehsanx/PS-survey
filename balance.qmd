## Summary of topics discussed 

### Definition

The Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) is a statistical measure used to quantify the size of the difference between two groups. It's often used in meta-analyses and systematic reviews to summarize the results across various studies, especially when different scales are used to measure an outcome.

### Application

SMD is useful in comparing the difference between groups when the variable is measured in different units across studies. An SMD of 0 indicates no difference between the groups, while its absolute value provides the size of the effect (e.g., |SMD| = 0.2: small effect, 0.5: medium effect, 0.8: large effect). While RCTs are designed to inherently balance covariates between groups through randomization, observational studies often require additional statistical methods to achieve and assess balance, with SMD being a valuable metric in this context.
