The slides illustrate the calculation of ATE using hypothetical individuals and their respective outcomes with and without treatment. The example underscores the concept of counterfactuals, which are essentially hypothetical scenarios representing what would have happened to the treated units in the absence of treatment. Later, we will learn about weighting, which can be implemented to estimate ATE, and matching, which can be implemented to estimate ATT.


## Summary of topics discussed 

### Introduction

The estimation of treatment effects, particularly the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), serves as a pivotal component in understanding the impact of interventions in both experimental and observational studies. This lecture delve into the conceptual underpinnings of these two estimands, elucidating their relevance and application in research contexts.

### Core Concepts

**Treatment Effect for an Individual (TE)**: This refers to the effect of a treatment or intervention on an individual, often calculated as the difference in outcomes with and without the treatment.

**Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**: ATE is computed as the expected difference in outcomes between units (e.g., individuals) with and without the treatment across the entire population. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
$ATE=E[Y(A=1)âˆ’Y(A=0)]$ where Y(A=1) and Y(A=0) denote the potential outcomes with and without the treatment, respectively.

**Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)**: ATT, on the other hand, focuses on the expected difference in outcomes specifically among those units that received the treatment.

### Difference

ATE estimates the average effect of treatment across the entire population, comparing outcomes when everyone is treated versus when no one is treated. In contrast, ATT estimates the effect only for those who actually received the treatment, with a primary focus on the treated group and a comparison group selected to closely match their characteristics. ATE is generally more pertinent for policy-making, where a policy or intervention might be applied broadly, while ATT is more relevant for understanding the effect on a specific subgroup, i.e., those who receive the treatment.

### Comparative Analysis of ATE and ATT

In the realm of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with a sufficiently large sample size, ATE and ATT are equivalent due to the random assignment of treatment, mitigating selection bias. However, in observational studies, where treatment assignment might be influenced by observed or unobserved factors, ATE and ATT may diverge. Both ATE and ATT can be estimated at different levels, namely:

- Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE)
- Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE)
- Population Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (PATT)
- Sample Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (SATT)

### Conclusion

Navigating through the nuanced landscape of treatment effect estimation, the concepts of ATE and ATT emerge as crucial estimands, each offering a unique lens through which the impact of interventions can be assessed and compared. While they converge under the stringent conditions of RCTs, their divergence in observational studies underscores the necessity to meticulously choose and interpret these estimands in alignment with the research question and study design.
