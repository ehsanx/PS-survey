    "text": "Key terms and Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\n\nConnection with Previous courses: This lecture, focusing on propensity score analysis within survey data analysis, consists of four main sections. The first three sections may overlap with content from other prerequisite courses (such as SPPH 500-007 or SPPH 506) and may serve as a refresher if you have taken either of those courses. If you have not taken those courses, these sections provide adequate material before the fourth section (the main component of this lecture).\nConnection with Previous Lectures: Within our current course SPPH 604, prior to this lecture, you have learned about survey data analysis and missing data analysis. These topics will be instrumental in enhancing your understanding of propensity score analysis within the context of complex survey data analysis. The concept of subpopulations will be particularly valuable when handling the matching aspect of the analysis, where part of the data is omitted within the complex survey data analysis context. Nonetheless, accurate variance estimation remains crucial despite such omission, a topic we will revisit in the lab.\nVideo content, and estimated time to watch: These sections include videos, which will take about 69 minutes to watch.\nOptional materials: Additional and advanced content is available for those who are interested, but exploring those sections is not mandatory.\nWhat is coming next in this week: After going through the required materials, you will be prepared for the upcoming lab content, where you will have the opportunity to implement the ideas discussed up to this point in the lecture in a series of real data analyses.\nWhat is coming next in upcoming lectures: An extension of these ideas will be discussed in an upcoming lecture, where we will explore the ramifications of using machine learning methods to estimate propensity scores.\n\n\n\nBefore delving into the various sections, let’s define some key terms and acronyms that will be used throughout:\n\nPropensity Scores (PS): The probability of a unit being assigned a particular treatment given observed covariates.\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE): A measure used to assess the overall impact of interventions across an entire population.\nAverage Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT): A measure that assesses the impact of interventions specifically on the treated units.\nStandardized Mean Difference (SMD): A statistical measure used to quantify the magnitude of difference between two groups.\nInverse Probability Weighting (IPW): A technique to create a synthetic sample in which the treatment assignment is independent of observed covariates."

    "section": "Outline of Topics",
    "text": "Outline of Topics\n\nTarget Parameters for an Associational or Causal Analysis\nThe section provides an in-depth exploration of the concepts and calculations related to ATE and ATT, pivotal components in assessing the impact of interventions in research. Through illustrative examples, it underscores the concept of counterfactuals and introduces the expressions for ATE and ATT, distinguishing between their applications and implications across different research contexts, particularly in RCTs and observational studies. The content further elaborates on variations of ATE and ATT, such as Population and Sample ATE/ATT, highlighting their relevance in policy-making and subgroup analysis. The nuanced differences between ATE and ATT, especially in observational studies where treatment assignment might be influenced by various factors, are emphasized, underscoring the importance of meticulous selection and interpretation of these estimands in alignment with the research question and study design.\n\n\nDiagnostics for Checking Covariate Balance\nThis section delves into the concept and application of the SMD, a statistical measure utilized to quantify the magnitude of difference between two groups. SMD not only facilitates the comparison of group differences when variables are measured in diverse units but also serves as a pivotal metric in assessing the balance of covariates between groups in observational studies, where achieving and verifying balance often necessitates additional statistical methodologies.\n\n\nPropensity Score Matching: Steps\nThis section elucidates the concept and application of PS in observational studies to mitigate bias stemming from confounding when treatment assignment is non-random. PS represents the probability of a unit being assigned a particular treatment given observed covariates and is pivotal in creating comparable groups for estimating causal effects. Through methodologies like logistic regression or machine learning techniques, PS is modeled, ensuring that selected variables are confounders or risk factors for the outcome while typically excluding instruments and noise variables. The section further distinguishes between PS matching and PS weighting, elaborating on their respective methodologies and applications in creating balanced comparison groups or synthetic samples. The four-step process of PS modeling, encompassing covariate specification, subject matching via PS (or weighting using IPW), covariate balance checking, and treatment effect estimation, is delineated, providing a structured approach to employing PS in research. The comparative analysis of PS and regression highlights their assumptions, applications, and the intuitive, diagnostic, and flexible advantages PS matching might offer.\n\n\nPropensity Score Matching in Complex Surveys\nThis section delves into the nuanced methodologies of employing PS models and outcome models within the context of surveys, exploring various approaches and their respective utilization of design variables. Through a tabular summary, the section juxtaposes different approaches, such as those by Zanutto (2006), DuGoff et al. (2014), Austin et al. (2018), and Lenis et al. (2017), alongside providing insights into the necessity and methodology of incorporating design variables in PS and outcome models.\n\n\nAssumptions for Causal Analyses (Optional)\nThis section delves into three fundamental assumptions in causal inference: Conditional Exchangeability, Positivity, and Causal Consistency. Conditional Exchangeability assumes that, when controlling for observed covariates, any difference in outcomes between treatment groups can be attributed to the treatment itself. Positivity ensures that every individual, regardless of their covariate combination, has a non-zero probability of receiving each treatment level, which is vital for estimating causal effects and avoiding mathematical issues in methods like propensity score weighting. Lastly, Causal Consistency stipulates that the observed outcomes under each treatment level align with the potential outcomes under that treatment level, ensuring the potential outcomes framework is well-defined. Together, these assumptions form the foundational bedrock for conducting robust and valid causal analyses, ensuring that the results and conclusions drawn are methodologically sound and interpretable.\n\n\nPropensity Score Weighting in Complex Surveys (Optional)\nThis section, designated as advanced and optional, meticulously explores the nuances of implementing IPW in the context of surveys, providing a detailed walkthrough of both the basic IPW process and its application within complex surveys. The content delineates a tabular summary that contrasts the steps involved in the basic IPW process with those in complex surveys. The steps encompass fitting the PS model, converting PS to IPW, checking balance using the SMD in IPW-weighted data, and applying the outcome model with respective weights. Notably, the section also introduces an alternative IPW for targeting ATT, offering comprehensive insights into the methodological adaptations required when navigating through the intricacies of weighting within survey data, thereby facilitating a robust framework for causal inference in observational studies with complex survey designs.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines for a Propensity Score Analysis (Optional)\nThis section, earmarked as advanced and optional, provides a structured and detailed framework for reporting analyses using PS methods in manuscripts, aiming to enhance the transparency and rigor of research findings. The guidelines, presented in a comprehensive table, delineate specific reporting items across various sections of a manuscript, including the Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.\n\n\nAdditional Contents / Workshops (Optional)\nThis section features video content from two workshops and a tutorial reference. Both workshops, accessible via embedded YouTube videos and accompanied by tutorial websites, offer in-depth insights and practical applications of PS methods in research contexts."

    "text": "Summary of topics discussed\n\nIntroduction\nThe estimation of treatment effects, particularly the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), serves as a pivotal component in understanding the impact of interventions in both experimental and observational studies. This lecture delve into the conceptual underpinnings of these two estimands, elucidating their relevance and application in research contexts.\n\n\nCore Concepts\nTreatment Effect for an Individual (TE): This refers to the effect of a treatment or intervention on an individual, often calculated as the difference in outcomes with and without the treatment.\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE): ATE is computed as the expected difference in outcomes between units (e.g., individuals) with and without the treatment across the entire population. Mathematically, it is expressed as: \\(ATE=E[Y(A=1)−Y(A=0)]\\) where Y(A=1) and Y(A=0) denote the potential outcomes with and without the treatment, respectively.\nAverage Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT): ATT, on the other hand, focuses on the expected difference in outcomes specifically among those units that received the treatment.\n\n\nDifference\nATE estimates the average effect of treatment across the entire population, comparing outcomes when everyone is treated versus when no one is treated. In contrast, ATT estimates the effect only for those who actually received the treatment, with a primary focus on the treated group and a comparison group selected to closely match their characteristics. ATE is generally more pertinent for policy-making, where a policy or intervention might be applied broadly, while ATT is more relevant for understanding the effect on a specific subgroup, i.e., those who receive the treatment.\n\n\nComparative Analysis of ATE and ATT\nIn the realm of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with a sufficiently large sample size, ATE and ATT are equivalent due to the random assignment of treatment, mitigating selection bias. However, in observational studies, where treatment assignment might be influenced by observed or unobserved factors, ATE and ATT may diverge. Both ATE and ATT can be estimated at different levels, namely:\n\nPopulation Average Treatment Effect (PATE)\nSample Average Treatment Effect (SATE)\nPopulation Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (PATT)\nSample Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (SATT)\n\n\n\nConclusion\nNavigating through the nuanced landscape of treatment effect estimation, the concepts of ATE and ATT emerge as crucial estimands, each offering a unique lens through which the impact of interventions can be assessed and compared. While they converge under the stringent conditions of RCTs, their divergence in observational studies underscores the necessity to meticulously choose and interpret these estimands in alignment with the research question and study design.\n\n\nReferences (Optional)\n\nGreifer, N., & Stuart, E.

It’s often used in meta-analyses and systematic reviews to summarize the results across various studies, especially when different scales are used to measure an outcome.\n\n\nApplication\nSMD is useful in comparing the difference between groups when the variable is measured in different units across studies. An SMD of 0 indicates no difference between the groups, while its absolute value provides the size of the effect (e.g., |SMD| = 0.2: small effect, 0.5: medium effect, 0.8: large effect). While RCTs are designed to inherently balance covariates between groups through randomization, observational studies often require additional statistical methods to achieve and assess balance, with SMD being a valuable metric in this context.\n\n\nReferences (Optional)\n\nFranklin, Jessica M., Jeremy A.

It is used to reduce bias due to confounding in observational studies where treatment assignment is not random. The propensity score is typically denoted as \\(Pr(A=1 | L)\\) where Pr is the probability of receiving the treatment given covariate L.\n\n\nModeling Propensity Score\nModeling PS involves estimating the probability of treatment assignment based on observed covariates. Common methods include:\n\nLogistic Regression: Often used to estimate PS, where the dependent variable is the treatment assignment, and independent variables are the covariates.\nMachine Learning Methods: Such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, can also be used, especially when the relationship between covariates and treatment assignment is complex."

    "section": "Choosing Variables",
    "text": "Choosing Variables\nVariables to be included in a PS model should be those that are:\n\nConfounders\nrisk factor for the outcome\n\nWe usually avoid instruments and noise variables. Looking at outcome data while modelling PS are usually discouraged.\n\nPS Matching vs. PS Weighting\nPS Matching: Involves pairing treated and untreated units with similar PS to create a balanced comparison group. Matching can be done through various methods like nearest neighbor, caliper matching, etc.\nPS Weighting: Involves assigning weights to each unit based on their PS to create a synthetic sample in which the distribution of observed covariates is independent of treatment assignment. Common methods include inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).\n\n\nFour Steps of PS Modeling\n\nSpecify Covariates and Fit Model: Identify and select relevant covariates, and fit a model (e.g., logistic regression) to estimate PS.\nMatch Subjects by Estimated PS: Use the estimated PS to match treated and untreated units, ensuring they are comparable.\nCovariate Balance Checking: Assess whether the matching or weighting has successfully balanced the covariates across treatment groups.\nEstimation of Treatment Effect: Analyze the outcome using the matched or weighted sample to estimate the causal effect of the treatment.\n\n\n\nPS vs. Regression\nPS is used to balance covariates across treatment groups to create a quasi-experimental design, while regression is used to directly estimate the relationship between treatment and outcome. Assumptions: Both PS and regression methods assume that all relevant covariates are observed (no hidden bias). They also require correct specification of the functional form of the relationship between covariates, treatment, and outcome.\nWhen comparing the estimates of Odds Ratios (OR) and Confidence Intervals (CI) from PS matching and regression models, they might not differ significantly. However, there are several reasons why researchers might still opt for PS matching:\nIntuitive Comparison: PS matching allows for an intuitive and straightforward comparison between two groups that are similar in observed covariates, facilitating easier interpretation and explanation of results.\nEase of Diagnostics: Checking the balance of covariates across matched groups (balance checking) can be more straightforward and intuitive than evaluating regression diagnostics, such as residual plots or influence diagnostics.\nSeparation of Models: PS matching separates the model for the exposure (treatment assignment) from the model for the outcome, which can be beneficial in ensuring that the method for estimating treatment effects is not too dependent on the specification of the outcome model.\nFlexibility with Assumptions: PS methods, especially those utilizing machine learning approaches, can relax the linearity assumption in estimating PS, providing more flexibility in handling complex relationships between covariates and treatment assignment."
